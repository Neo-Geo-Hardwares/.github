# Neo-Geo Hardwares repository

Neo-Geo was introduced to the world on 1990.

The Neo Geo originally launched as the Multi Video System (MVS) coin-operated arcade machine.

With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can easily be changed to a different game title by swapping the game's cartridge and cabinet artwork.

The Neo Geo was marketed as the first 24-bit system; its CPU is actually a 16/32-bit 68000 with an 8-bit Z80 coprocessor, while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus.
It was design as two separate (but compatible) market branches MVS and AES.

## Why this project

Until now, only poorly scanned schematics documentation is available and for only one AES model and one MVS, despite an huge communities, no good scan or documents exist.
Their is a lot of usefull resources, but so far I never seen any "modern" or good scan schematics.

This project is trying to re-create schemactics for the Neo-Geo from the existing copy.

## About the author

Some words about me, Frater, I'm working on this project as an hobbyiest, trying to fix some of my MVS board.

## Methodology

I do use an edited photo with the underlayer PCB "visible" over the top layer.
